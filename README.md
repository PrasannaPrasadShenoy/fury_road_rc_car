# fury_road_rc_car

## Overview
This project involves building a remote-controlled (RC) car using Arduino and various electronic components. The car can be controlled wirelessly via a remote controller or a smartphone app.

## Features
- **Wireless Control:** The car can be remotely controlled using either a dedicated remote controller or a smartphone app connected via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.
- **Direction Control:** It supports forward, backward, left, and right movements, providing full directional control.
- **Speed Adjustment:** The speed of the car can be adjusted to suit different environments or user preferences.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Sensors and feedback mechanisms provide real-time data on battery levels, motor speed, and environmental conditions.

## Components
- **Arduino Board:** Acts as the brain of the RC car, processing input signals and controlling various components.
- **Motor Driver (L298N):** Regulates the power supply to the motors and enables bidirectional control.
- **DC Motors:** Drive the wheels of the car and determine its movement.
- **Wireless Module (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi):** Establishes communication between the remote controller/app and the car.
- **Power Source:** Typically, a rechargeable battery powers the RC car, providing mobility and flexibility.

## Installation
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect the Arduino board, motor driver, motors, and wireless module according to the provided circuit diagram.
2. **Software Installation:** Upload the Arduino sketch provided in the repository to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Remote Controller/App Setup:** Pair the remote controller or configure the smartphone app to establish a connection with the RC car.

## Usage
1. **Power On:** Ensure that the RC car and the remote controller/app are powered on and properly connected.
2. **Control Interface:** Use the buttons on the remote controller or the virtual controls in the smartphone app to steer and control the car.
3. **Monitoring:** Monitor the real-time feedback provided by the car's sensors to maintain optimal performance and safety.
4. **Charging:** Recharge the battery periodically to ensure uninterrupted operation of the RC car.
